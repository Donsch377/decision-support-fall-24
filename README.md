# Decision Support Project

This directory is associated with an effort to develop an aid for making decisions with multiple alternatives and multiple factors.

The [Decision Support Application - Overview](https://metrocs.github.io/cs3250_practice/ProductOverview.html)
contains the initial information used to kick off the project.

## Vision

Our application helps decision-makers by leveraging psychometric and mathematical models. By gathering user input, the application determines the relative value of each potential choice, helping users make more confident decisions.

## Stakeholders

### Established Stakeholders

**Decision-Maker** -- A person who desires assistance in deciding their best option from among multiple alternatives

**Maintainer** -- A person with responsibility for updating the product (including fixes and enhancements)
<!--
### Potential Stakeholders

**SysAdmin** -- A system administrator responsible for installing the product for others' use and keeping it available
