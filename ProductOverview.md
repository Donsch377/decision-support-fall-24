# Decision Support Application - Overview 
## Scope of the Product
### A Decision Support application that assists users in making decisions where:

Users need to assess multiple alternatives for the decision.
Users must consider multiple factors (criteria) for the decision.
Each factor can have a different level of relative importance.
Psychometric scales facilitate capturing users’ preferences and priorities.
Mathematical models (e.g., weighted scoring, decision matrices, Analytical Hierarchy Process) are useful in determining recommendations that reflect the users’ preferences.

### Key Product Requirements

**The Decision Support application must:**
Allow users to define potential decision outcomes (e.g., different choices or alternatives).
Allow users to define multiple factors (e.g., cost, time, quality, personal preference) and assign relative weights.
Use a scoring model to compute the best decision based on the defined factors, weights, and psychometric assessments.
Display a summary of the relative ranking of all decision outcomes, including a final recommendation.
Provide a user-friendly experience with a clear and intuitive User Interface.

**Functional Requirements**

1. User Input
   Provide an interface to define alternatives, decision criteria, and the relative weights of criteria.
   Allow users to rate different alternatives according to each criterion.
2. Psychometric Principles
   Implement a psychometric scale (e.g., AHP) to rate the relative importance of the factors.
   Calculate decision priorities based on user preferences.
3. Mathematical Model
   Integrate a decision-making algorithm (e.g., weighted decision matrix, AHP) to generate scores for each alternative.
   Present a final ranking and decision recommendation based on the highest score(s).
   Non-Functional Requirements
4. User Interface
   Ensure the UI is simple, intuitive, and easy to navigate.
   Display decisions and explanations clearly, using visual elements (e.g., charts, tables).
   Provide clear error messages and helpful feedback for invalid inputs.
6. Platforms
   Ensure the application is responsive and works across multiple devices.
